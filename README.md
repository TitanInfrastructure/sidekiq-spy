# Sidekiq Spy

[Sidekiq](https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq) monitoring in the console.
A bit like Sidekiq::Web. But without the web.

So, Sidekiq is a beautiful thing. :) But if you know the sadness of wanting to
see how your workers are doing at-a-glance when SSHed into a remote box with
no web server, this one's for you. <3

This project is so hot out of the oven you might need mitts. But it's already
functional, with the main statistics from the Sidekiq::Web homepage and the
Workers, Queues, Retries, and Scheduled tabs.

More sleep lost by [tiredpixel](http://www.tiredpixel.com).

## Installation

Install using:

    $ gem install sidekiq-spy


## Usage

View the available options:

    $ sidekiq-spy --help

If you're connecting to `redis://127.0.0.1:6379/0` with no namespace you can
simply:

    $ sidekiq-spy

To use a connection string URL:

    $ sidekiq-spy -u redis://da.example.com:237/42

Or, if you prefer your options like your Hi-Fi:

    $ sidekiq-spy -h da.example.com -p 237 -d 42

Maybe you're using [Resque](https://github.com/resque/resque)? Sssh!
We won't tell anyone! ;) (Resque is awesome, too!)

    $ sidekiq-spy -n resque

Navigate between tabs using the `<w>`, `<u>`, `<r>`, `<s>` keys.

To quit, press `<q>` or `<ctrl>+<c>`. That's about it.

## Growing Like Flowers

Dear Me, Here is a vague wishlist:

- Queue (not Queues) page
- Retry (not Retries) page
- Paginated data
- a little control to go with your monitoring, maybe...
